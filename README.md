# Javascript

Javascript is an essential language for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It is with this in mind that after the online training on this language that I followed, I developed this page allowing you to check a user's entry depending on whether they want to practice entering words or sentences. At the end he has the possibility to share his final score with other people.
